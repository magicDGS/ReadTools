     * Directory for example data used in the Walkthrough. This data belongs to the documentation

     * a bug.
     *
     * <p>The tools and engine should work on this data without any modification, because they are
     * suppose to represent the same data. If a modification its required, that means one of the
     * following and it should be handled as following:
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * ReadTools framework cannot roundtrip the files due to lossy formats. The files were
     * created to be aware of this flaw of formats, in the minimum expression, so modification due
     * to this issue should be done only if it is strictly necessary. Otherwise, tests should
     * require a different dataset to test this functionality.
     * For example, the SAM header in FASTQ cannot be encoded, and thus output files from the same
     * input with different headers will fail validation. Thus, all the headers are simple in the
     * SAM-formatted files.
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * Corrupted data. Some of the data may be outdated or may have problems with further
     * development. If that is the case, this represents a backwards incompatible change and the
     * tests involving this files should be disabled in favor of new tests files. With version
     * updates, the tests files may be modified and tests re-enabled.
     * For instance, if a SAM-formatted file requires a 'queryname' ordering and the files in the
     * current folder are 'unsorted', this will break functionality.
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * Functionality is broken and requires a workaround in the tests files until it is fixed. This
     * is completely discouraged and this kind of change in the test data may be accepted only in
     * extremealy rare cases.
     * </li>
     * </ul>

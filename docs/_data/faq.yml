  question: "AssignReadGroupByBarcode 'UNEXPECTED ERROR: 1'"
  answer: '<p><i><b>This error is solved in versions > 1.0.0</b></i></p>
    In version 1.0.0 or lower, when a barcode file with more than one barcode
	is provided and the barcodes are not encoded in the <b>BC</b> tag separated by hyphens as recommended in
	the SAM specifications. There are several reported cases:
	<ul>
		<li>Barcodes encoded in two different tags. For example, BAM files obtained with
			<a href="http://gq1.github.io/illumina2bam/#Illumina2bam">illumina2bam</a>
			use to have dual-indexed datasets with the first barcode in the <b>BC</b> tag
			and the second in the <b>B2</b> tag. This could be fixed by using the following
			options: <code>--rawBarcodeSequenceTags BC --rawBarcodeSequenceTags B2</code>.
			Data from other sources may require a different values for this argument.
		</li>
		<li>Barcode encoded in the <b>BC</b> tag but separated with a custom character. In this
			case, we recommend to reformat your data with <code>awk</code> or <code>sed</code>.
			We also have implemented an advance solution for laboratories where the data is always
			encoded with a custom separator, and it should not be modified (for more information, see
			<a href="readtools_java_properties.html">ReadTools Java Properties</a>).
		</li>
	</ul>'
